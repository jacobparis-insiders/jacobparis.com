A normal switch can look like this

```js numbered
switch (color) {
  case "red":
    return "apple"
  case "yellow":
    return "banana"
  default:
    return null
}
```

The inverted switch looks like this

```js numbered
switch (true) {
  case color === "red":
    return "apple"
  case color === "yellow":
    return "banana"
}
```

This is similar to a series of inline if statements

```js numbered
if (color === "red") return "apple"

if (color === "yellow") return "banana"
```

For if statements to span multiple expressions, they need enclosing braces

```js numbered
if (color === "red") {
  const apple = getApple()
  apple.shape = "round"

  return apple
}

if (color === "yellow") {
  const banana = getBanana()
  banana.shape = "banana-shape?"

  return banana
}
```

But switch statements can increase in complexity without additional syntax

```js numbered
switch (true) {
  case color === "red":
    const apple = getApple()
    apple.shape = "round"

    return apple

  case color === "yellow":
    const banana = getBanana()
    banana.shape = "banana-shape?"

    return banana
}
```

To handle OR conditions, if statements require the `||` operator

```js numbered
if (color === 'red' || color === 'green')
```

Switches have a fall-through feature where they continue if there is no return or break keyword, so multiple OR cases can share a single execution block. In this example, both red and green will return an apple.

```js numbered
switch (true) {
  case color === "red":
  case color === "green":
    const apple = getApple()

    return apple

  case color === "yellow":
    const banana = getBanana()
    banana.shape = "banana-shape?"

    return banana
}
```
