## Computer

Early 2011 MacBook Pro 13" - with 8GB RAM and a 128GB Samsung 850 Evo SSD. Considering swapping out the disk drive with another storage disk

2019 MacBook Pro 15" - this is my work machine. There's a [minor flashing issue](https://twitter.com/jacobmparis/status/1264612711830360065?s=20) on the touch-bar when it goes into standby, but nothing that's impacted my functionality.

Whichever computer, I keep it propped up with my NexStand

## Keyboard

I type on a combination of these

- Apple Magic keyboard
- Apple Magic trackpad
- [Twelve South Magic Bridge](https://www.amazon.ca/Twelve-South-MagicBridge-Connects-Trackpad/dp/B01N9D63YE?tag=jacobparis-20) – This bridge keeps the keyboard and trackpad acting like a single unit which is great for sitting on the lap or working off the couch streaming from the TV

## Personal

Mpow bluetooth earbuds. They aren't quite airpod quality but they come in airpod style and all I listen to are Spotify streams so it's all the same to me.

My phone is an iPhone XR, and I'll probably stick to iphone when I upgrade

## Code

I use VS Code with the [Lover](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jacobparis.lover) theme I've been building. It's still very work in progress, and I'll probably end up hiring someone to finish it (ie, make it look nice outside of my narrow javascript syntax highlighting needs)

The font I use is [Comic Code Ligatures]() which I bought as a joke but then fell in love. It makes me so happy to look at and I'm never switching.

An example of my theme and font can be seen here
