If you're adding Typescript to a Vue project, you need to do a bit of extra work to make Single File Components load properly into the type system.

Typescript will throw an error if you try to import a `.vue` file if it doesn't understand how to parse it as a Vue SFC.

```sh
Error: Cannot resolve module './MyComponent.vue'
```

To resolve this, create a `shims-vue.d.ts` file in your project root.

```ts
declare module "*.vue" {
  import Vue from "vue"
  export default Vue
}
```

Add the shim file to your `tsconfig.json` file.

```json numbered {6}
{
  "extends": "../../tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./lib" // Your outDir
  },
  "files": ["./shims-vue.d.ts"],
  "include": ["./src", "./src/**/*.vue"]
}
```

Then restart the TS engine, either by recompiling if you're doing so from the command line, or in VS Code by opening the command palette and searching for `Typescript: Restart TS Server`
