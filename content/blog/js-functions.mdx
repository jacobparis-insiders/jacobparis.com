A function is a block of code that can be called and executed at will

```js numbered
function setTitle() {
  document.title = "Async, Await, and Promises"
}
```

This gives us a function named `setTitle`. To execute it, call it by name with parentheses after, like `setTitle()`

## Arguments

Functions can also have **arguments**, which are variables you pass into a function when you call it.

```js numbered
function setTitle(title) {
  document.title = title
}

setTitle("Async, Await, and Promises")
```

This makes functions much more reusable, since you can call it with any value you want

```js numbered
setTitle("Who me?")
setTitle("Yes you.")
setTitle("Couldn't be")
setTitle("Then who?")
```

## Callbacks

When you call a function, sometimes it can **call back** to another function

The `setTimeout` function accepts two arguments: a callback function, which it executes when it's finished waiting, and a delay, which is the number of milliseconds to wait

```js numbered
function setTimeout(callback, delay)
```

We can use this to call our original setTitle function automatically after one second.

```js numbered
function setTitle() {
  document.title = "Async, Await, and Promises"
}

setTimeout(setTitle, 1000)
```

This works since we're setting the title explicitly, but if we try to pass it in as an argument it just clears the title, shown below

```js numbered
function setTitle(title) {
  document.title = title
}

setTimeout(setTitle, 1000)
```

What happened? Since the callback (setTitle) is executed by the function (setTimeout) we don't have control over what arguments setTitle is called with.

So instead of passing `setTitle` as our callback, we can make our callback a wrapper function instead

```js numbered
// Pattern 1: Named Function
function wrappedSetTitle() {
  setTitle("Async, Await, and Promises")
}
setTimeout(wrappedSetTitle, 1000)
```

```js numbered
// Pattern 2: Anonymous Function
setTimeout(function () {
  setTitle("Async, Await, and Promises")
}, 1000)
```

```js numbered
// Pattern 3: Arrow Function
setTimeout(() => {
  setTitle("Async, Await, and Promises")
}, 1000)
```

```js numbered
// Pattern 4: Inline Arrow function
setTimeout(
  () => setTitle("Async, Await, and Promises"),
  1000,
)
```

Now setTimeout will wait until 1000 milliseconds have passed, then invoke our wrapper function which calls `setTitle` with a title of our choice
