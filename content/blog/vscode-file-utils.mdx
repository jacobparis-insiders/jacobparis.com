I looked up this VS Code extension on impulse one day but it has since become one of my favourites. There's a lot of functionality built in but the part I use the most is the new context menu item for duplicating files

This extension adds `duplicate` and `move` options to the context menu

Selecting one prompts you to pick a path for the new or moved file
