title: Partially match a subset of an object's fields in Typescript
description: I had a type that acted as a schema, but one implementation only needed a subset of its fields, so I had to find a solution.

I have a type `Contact` that gets used in multiple places. A `Person` can have a contact, so it becomes a field on their type, but also a `Company` can have a contact.

```ts
export interface Contact {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  phoneNumber: string
}

export type Person = {
  id: string
  contact: Contact
}

export type Company = {
  id: string
  contact: Contact
}
```

```js
const company = {
  id: uuid(),
  contact: {
    phoneNumber: "+123456790",
  },
}
```

produces the error

```sh
Type '{ phoneNumber: string; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Contact': firstName, lastName
```

Typescript expects that all implementations of the `Contact` type use every defined field, but since a business doesn't need to have a first or last name, I don't want to have to add those.

## The solution

There are several typescripty ways to solve this

### New type

One solution is to stop messing around with reusability and just make a new type for this clearly different use-case.

```ts
export interface CompanyContact {
  phoneNumber: string
}

export type Company = {
  id: string
  contact: CompanyContact
}
```

### Partial

The Partial type makes every field optional

```ts
export type Company = {
  id: string
  contact: Partial<Contact>
}
```

### Pick

Pick allows you to pick specifically which fields you want

```ts
export type Company = {
  id: string
  contact: Pick<Contact, "phoneNumber">
}
```
