I discovered this extension through the [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) recommended extensions

> You can find [Paste Image on VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image)

This extension allows you to paste images directly into your code in any format you want.

![](/images/vscode-paste-image_2021-06-07-01-17-30.png)

The image in the clipboard is saved as a `.png` into my `/public/images` folder (where Next.js wants it) and inserts a Markdown image tag like this:

```md
![](/images/vscode-paste-image_2021-06-07-01-17-30.png)
```

I have configured this locally to the workspace (instead of globally) because each project will have different requirements about where to serve images and how to reference them.

```json numbered labeled filepath[.vscode/settings.json]
{
  "pasteImage.path": "${projectRoot}/public/images",
  "pasteImage.basePath": "/images",
  "pasteImage.namePrefix": "${currentFileNameWithoutExt}_",
  "pasteImage.insertPattern": "![](/images/${imageFileName})"
}
```
